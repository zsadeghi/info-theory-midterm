# Information Theory Mid-term

This is the code portion of the Information Theory course
I have taken at the University of Washington.

For this work, I have implemented Shannon's entropy, the LZ78 algorithm, and the
Huffman coding algorithm.

A working console can be used to try out all these works.

The input data is read from the file `sample.txt` which contains the full text
of the book "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" as taken from the Gutenberg archive.
